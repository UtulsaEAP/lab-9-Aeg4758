Complete a program that takes a weight in kilograms as input, converts the weight to pounds, and then outputs the weight in pounds. 1 kilogram = 2.204 pounds (lbs).

The program must define the following function:
def kilo_to_pounds(kilos) - take kilos as a parameter, convert kilos from kilograms to pounds, and return the weight in pounds.

Ex: If the input of the program is:
        
        10


10 is passed to kilo_to_pounds() and the output of the program is:

      22.040 lbs

The program  has an error in the kilo_to_pounds() function.



Change the kilo_to_pounds() function to multiply the variable kilos by 2.204, instead of dividing. The return statement should be: return (kilos * 2.204). Submit and Now the test cases should all pass.
